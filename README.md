UNzip the folder 15726701-master. Navigate to it in the node.js terminal. Once inside the folder run ionic serve --lab. 

To download the entire project go to https://github.com/nashg96/15726701
Download the file as a zip. When you save it navigate to the folder in the terminal. Once inside the the folder, Run the command “ionic serve - -lab” to view the application on iOS and android. To view as website run “ionic serve”. 



______________________________________________________________
If you receive this error in the terminal,

[ERROR] ionic-app-scripts has unexpectedly closed (exit code 1).

Run the command “npm rebuild node-sass”

Now serve the application.

_______________________________________________________________

If you receive errors when in the browser when the application is served, open any .ts file in the pages folder in “sublime editor”[already installed on department computers].

Once the .ts file is open, just save it, “ctrl s” 

Example: 
open the pages folder, 
click on the “home” folder. 
Open home.ts in sublime. 
Save.

There should be a notification in the browser saying “building”,
The application should now run.

_______________________________________________________________

To use the application:
1.Register an email address and password
2.Return to the login page
3.Enter your details and log in

Side-Notes:
On profile page user scores on the bar chart will only load after you have entered and exited the page. Was unable to find why this was happening.
The calendar utility is unable to create events as the calendar package that was compatible with my ionic project was unfortunately removed recently.
