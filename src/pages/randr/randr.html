	Although the ability to commit information to memory is greatly enhanced through repetition or rehearsal, not all rehearsal techniques are effective in facilitating later recall. Simply saying something to oneself over and over again, a technique called “rote rehearsal,” helps to retain the information in short-term memory but does little to build a long-term memory of the event.<br>
<br>
	More-effective types of rehearsal consist of reflection—thinking about the material one is trying to learn and discovering ways in which it is related to something one already knows.<br>
