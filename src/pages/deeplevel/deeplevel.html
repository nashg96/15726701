	Deep processing is a way of learning in which you try to make the information meaningful to yourself. For example, you might try to figure out how a lesson on animal biology fits into what you already know about your dog.<br>
<br>
	Here are three ways to process information deeply:
<br>
	<font color="black">1.Elaborate on the information.</font><br>
	When you are given new information, begin by asking yourself how this relates to what you already know. This creates pathways where the new information can “live” in your brain.<br>
	<font color="black">2.Make distinctions</font><br>
	You put the information side-by-side with other concepts and ask yourself what the key differences are?<br>
	<font color="black">3.Apply it to your life</font><br>
	Try using the information in real life. For instance, if you are studying human anatomy, try to name the bones you use when you brush your teeth or ride a bike.<br>
