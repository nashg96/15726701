We remember pictures much more than words. If you remember a name think of name in terms of a picture to help remember it.<br>
<br>
The three basic steps of the Visualization technique are:<br>
<br>
<font color="black">1.</font>Use "substitute words" to break down complex concepts.<br>
	Associating new information with information your already know is the key to really memorizing something. If you can associate new information with an image you can easily visualize, that new information will become much more firmly locked in your memory.You can convert any concept, word, symbol, or other information to something familiar by breaking down the sounds that make up the word and then thinking of memorable images of the parts.<br>
	<br>
<font color="black">2.</font>Use your imagination to create vivid mental images of the ideas.<br>
	To build strong mental connections to the new information, the images must be very memorable, because ordinary things are too forgettable.<br>
	<br>
<font color="black">3.</font>Mentally associate the visual images you created to each other.<br>
	In Steps #1 and #2 you think of substitute words for any complex words and then create vivid mental images of those words. Step #3 is where you start connecting the information together.<br>
	<br>

<br>
<font color="black">Example:</font><br>
	Here is a simple example that uses "substitute word" plus visualization to memorize that the capital of Bulgaria is the city Sofia. I've pulled the three steps explained above into one image that shows how this technique works.<br>
