	Make up a story or rhyme that contains information that you want to remember!<br>
<br>
	Putting information into a short poem or rhyming phrase helps you remember the phrase as the end of each line ends in a similar sound, creating a singsong pattern that is easier to remember. The end of each line almost gives you a hint as to  what the end of the next line shall be!

		“In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue” was used in school to help us remember when columbus sailed.
