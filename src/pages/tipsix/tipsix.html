	Improving your general well-being is one of the most  important parts when it comes to maintaing a healthy memory.<br>
<br>
	Here are some tips to help you keep on top of your health:<br>
<br>
	<font color="black">1. Sleep well</font><br>
		Sleeping well helps reinforce episodic memories – those associated with time and place. Having a full night’s sleep soon after gaining a new skill helps consolidate the processes involved so they can later be performed “on autopilot”.<br>
		<br>
	<font color="black">2. Exercise regularly</font><br>
	Exercise helps memory and thinking through both direct and indirect means. The benefits of exercise come directly from its ability to reduce insulin resistance, reduce inflammation, and stimulate the release of growth factors—chemicals in the brain that affect the health of brain cells, the growth of new blood vessels in the brain, and even the abundance and survival of new brain cells.<br>

Indirectly, exercise improves mood and sleep, and reduces stress and anxiety. Problems in these areas frequently cause or contribute to cognitive impairment.<br>
<br>
	<font color="black">3. Find time to relax</font><br>
		Stress affects memory in different ways depending on when the stressful event occurs. Getting stressed out just before efforts to retrieve memories impairs our ability to do so. Yoga, meditation or other relaxation techniques may help.<br>
		<br>
	<font color="black">4. Eat healthy </font><br>
		 Research suggests eating a healthy diet could potentially be linked to a lower risk of memory and thinking decline.<br>
