	Getting into a daily routine can help you form good habits and breka bad ones. Here are some tips on creating a healthy daily routine for yourself.<br>
<br>
	<font color="black">1. Make a List</font><br>
		Write down everything you need to get done daily, both in your home life and at work. Donâ€™t worry about how you organize this list; this is a brain dump, not a to-do list. Take 30 minutes with a notebook to jot down everything you do each day, as well as everything you should get done.<br>
	<font color="black">2. Structure Your Day</font><br>
		Think about when you work best, and group your tasks into the time of day that makes the most sense for when you will best complete them.<br>
	<font color="black">3. Schedule in Time for Flexibility</font><br>
		Always account for flexibilty. Sometimes life will get in the way of your routine and that is OK. A daily routine will keep things flowing despite the hiccups.<br>
	<font color="black">4. Test Your New Routine</font><br>
		Test your new routine for 30 days. How does it feel? Did you schedule your tasks and activities at times that make sense? Do you need to adjust things? Tweak anything that is not working on a case-by-case basis, and then do an assessment after 30 days to see how your new routine is working for you.
