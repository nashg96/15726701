	The more often you have encountered a piece of information the less often you need to refresh it to keep it in your memory. However, even the most familiar information will be forgotten if it is not encountered or refreshed for a very long time.<br> 
<br> 
	It is for example not uncommon that people who move to another country will over longer periods of time loose their ability to speak their own mother tongue properly.<br> 
<br> 
	The expanded rehearsal technique is based on this informaation. Repeat the information you intend to learn in your mind immediately after you have taken it in. Test yourself after a slight delay. Increase the delay to a longer period like a couple of hours. Finally test yourself after a few days.
