A common reason people don’t take their medication is because they simply forget. Here are some tips you could use to help you remember!<br>
<br>
<font color="black">1. Use a pillbox.</font><br>

	The best and easiest strategy is to put your medication in a weekly pillbox that has a compartment for each day. It doesn’t just visually remind you to take your medication but also prevents double doses<br>
<font color="black">2. Take advantage of technology.</font><br>
	f you’re usually plugged in, set up electronic reminders. For instance, you can create email or text alerts to signal it’s time to take your medicine.<br>
<font color="black">3. Combine with a daily task.</font><br>
	Tie taking your medication with an activity you do every day, such as making coffee or brushing your teeth<br>
<font color="black">4. Set an alarm.</font><br>
	Setting a daily alarm can be helpful, especially if the timing requirements for when you are supposed to take it tend to be tighter<br>
<font color="black">5. Keep it visible.</font><br>
Remember the phrase "out of sight, out of mind”. So if you’re just starting your medication, leave it out in an easy-to-spot place<br>
<font color="black">6. Enlist a loved one’s help.</font><br>
It can help to have a non-judgmental, positive person who understands your situation support you through treatment. This person can help you remember to take your medicine <br>
