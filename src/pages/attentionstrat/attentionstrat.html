  <h1>Pay attention and focus on whats being said. Try to reduce background distractions.</h1>

1. PREPARE YOUR BRAIN<br>
	<font color="black">Before a task, calm your brain, let your body calm down before you approach your work. Youâ€™ll find it really helps you concentrate.<br></font>
2. UNDERSTAND WHERE YOUR FOCUS NEEDS TO BE<br>
	 <font color="black">Take time to identify what deserves your focus<br></font>
3. UNPLUG FOR 30 MINUTES<br>
	<font color="black">If you need to focus, log out of email and social media. Do yourself a favor and log out for 30 minutes either in the beginning of the day or for a period in the afternoon<br></font>
4. TURN ON SOME MUSIC<br>
	<font color="black">Too much background noise can be very distracting, but having music you like playing can help you focus on your own thoughts. <br></font>
5. TAKE SHORT BREAKS
	<font color="black">Instead of succumbing to distraction, build it in. Working with short breaks can be more productive than working straight through a task.</font>
